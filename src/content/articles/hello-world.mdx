Welcome to my first article. This is a simple example of how to write content using MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use JSX in your content. This means you can:

- Write regular markdown
- Use React components
- Import and use other components
- Add interactive elements

### Example Code Block

```javascript
console.log('Hello from MDX!')
```
