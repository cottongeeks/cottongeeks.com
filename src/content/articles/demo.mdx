# Hello World!

Welcome to my first article. This is a simple example of how to write content using MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use JSX in your content. This means you can:

- Write regular markdown
- Use React components
- Import and use other components
- Add interactive elements

### Example Code Block

```javascript
console.log('Hello from MDX!')
```

Feel free to explore more articles on this site!

### React component

Here's an interactive counter component:

<Counter client:load />

### Math

$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x
$$

Inline: Euler's identity is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.
