The [last post](https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723) about uv and PEP 723 [blew up on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369388), which indicates that uv is having a moment. However uv is still relatively new and may have some sharp edges. I discovered one such case with a package I am using, which I am documenting below.

## llm

[llm](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) is a popular package by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) that is _a CLI tool and Python library for interacting with **OpenAI**, **Anthropic’s Claude**, **Google’s Gemini**, **Meta’s Llama** and dozens of other Large Language Models_.

```
$ llm who are you
I am an AI language model created by OpenAI. I'm designed to assist with a wide
range of questions and topics by providing information, answering queries, and
engaging in conversation. How can I help you today?
```

llm also supports a plugin architecture which can be used to extend the tool by adding new commands or models etc. Here is how to install the handy [llm-jq](https://github.com/simonw/llm-jq/tree/main) plugin, which helps to _write and execute jq programs with the help of LLM_

```
$ llm install llm-jq

$ llm plugins
[
  {
    "name": "llm-jq",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.1"
  }
]
```

and to demonstrate its usage using an example from the repo

```
$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/datasette/issues | \
  llm jq 'count by user.login, top 3'
[
  {
    "login": "simonw",
    "count": 7
  },
  {
    "login": "commongeek",
    "count": 4
  },
  {
    "login": "asg017",
    "count": 2
  }
]
map(.user.login) | group_by(.) | map({login: .[0], count: length}) | sort_by(.count) | reverse | .[:3]
```

## Using llm with uv

llm can be installed with `uv tool`

```
uv tool install llm
```

installing the `llm-jq` plugin is the same as well.

```
$ llm install llm-jq

$ llm plugins
[
  {
    "name": "llm-jq",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.1"
  }
]
```

It's all good so far. But note that when we do `llm install llm-jq` we are installing the package via pip. So uv does not know about these dependencies. This will become a problem as we will see in the next section.

## Upgrading llm and related plugin issues

Now, if we want to upgrade llm, we can use `uv tool upgrade`

```
 $ uv tool upgrade llm
Modified llm environment
 - llm-jq==0.1.1
```

This output shows that `uv` upgraded the `llm` tool and made changes to its environment. The `llm-jq` plugin was removed from the environment (the minus sign indicates a removal). This likely happened because uv treats `llm-jq` as an unnecessary package, since it's not a dependency of llm.

Now, if we try to list the plugins, we discover that we have lost the `llm-jq` plugin from the new environment.

```
$ llm plugins
[]
```

This is actually a bug that (as of June 2025) is currently open in the llm repo: [llm loses track of plugins when upgraded (with uv and others) · Issue #575 · simonw/llm · GitHub](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/575)

## Workarounds

The comments under the bug list a bunch of workarounds. I am gonna point out a couple of good ones.

## Using llm-uv-tool

[llm-uv-tool](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/llm-uv-tool) is itself _a plugin for [LLM](https://github.com/simonw/llm) that enables proper plugin management when LLM is installed as a uv tool. It resolves compatibility issues between uv's isolated environment approach and LLM's plugin system._

It is best to install it along with `llm` the first time we install `llm`

```
$ uv tool install --with llm-uv-tool llm


```

and then proceed to install the `llm-jq` plugin

```
$ llm install llm-jq

$ llm plugins
[
  {
    "name": "llm-uv-tool",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.3"
  },
  {
    "name": "llm-jq",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.1"
  }
]
```

Now if we try to upgrade, all the plugins will be retained after the upgrade

```
$ uv tool upgrade llm

$ llm plugins
[
  {
    "name": "llm-uv-tool",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.3"
  },
  {
    "name": "llm-jq",
    "hooks": [
      "register_commands"
    ],
    "version": "0.1.1"
  }
]
```

The README in the [llm-uv-tool](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/llm-uv-tool) repo has notes on more advanced usage.

## Using llm's own upgrade command

Another option which is a bit inferior imo is to self-upgrade `llm` using

```
llm install -U llm
```

This will upgrade llm within the same environment it was originally installed by uv, and hence preserve the plugin. The reason this is a slightly inferior option is because this won't work if we want to upgrade llm using uv to another Python version.

```
uv tool upgrade --python 3.13 llm
```

This will reinstall llm with Python 3.13, but will not preserve the plugins.
